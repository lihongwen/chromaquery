# Progress Synchronization Fix

## Problem Description
The frontend progress indicator was not showing incremental progress updates during document upload. Instead, it remained at 0% throughout the upload process and then suddenly jumped to 100% completion. This created a poor user experience where users couldn't see the actual progress of vector storage operations.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the backend progress queue management system:

1. **Queue Size Limitation**: The progress queue had `maxsize=1`, which could only hold one progress update at a time
2. **Queue Clearing Logic**: The `send_embedding_progress` function was clearing all existing updates before adding new ones, causing intermediate progress updates to be lost
3. **No Throttling**: Rapid progress updates could overwhelm the system without proper throttling
4. **Poor Error Handling**: Limited error recovery for queue management issues

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Increased Queue Size
**File**: `backend/main.py` (line 1650-1651)
```python
# Before
progress_queue = asyncio.Queue(maxsize=1)

# After  
progress_queue = asyncio.Queue(maxsize=10)
```

### 2. Removed Queue Clearing Logic
**File**: `backend/main.py` (lines 1827-1866)
- Removed the logic that cleared the queue before adding new updates
- Now preserves all progress updates to ensure incremental display
- Added fallback logic to handle queue full scenarios by replacing oldest update

### 3. Implemented Progress Throttling
**File**: `backend/main.py` (lines 1806-1833)
- Added throttling mechanism to prevent overwhelming the frontend
- Updates are sent only when:
  - Time since last update ≥ 0.5 seconds
  - Progress change ≥ 2%
  - Processing is complete (processed == total)
  - Batch completion occurs

### 4. Enhanced Streaming and Error Handling
**File**: `backend/main.py` (lines 1877-1921)
- Improved timeout handling with consecutive timeout tracking
- Better cleanup of remaining progress updates
- Enhanced logging for debugging

## Technical Details

### Progress Flow
1. **Batch Processing**: Documents are processed in batches (5-10 per batch depending on embedding model)
2. **Progress Calculation**: Each batch completion triggers a progress update
3. **Throttling**: Updates are filtered to prevent excessive frequency
4. **Queue Management**: Updates are queued without clearing previous ones
5. **Streaming**: All queued updates are sent to frontend via Server-Sent Events (SSE)

### Frontend Integration
The frontend already had proper SSE handling in `CollectionDetail.tsx`:
- Parses streaming "data: " prefixed JSON messages
- Updates React state with progress information
- Displays progress bars with incremental updates

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- Progress indicator shows incremental updates (e.g., 65% → 70% → 75% → 80% → 85% → 90%)
- Users can see real-time progress during vector embedding and storage
- Smooth progress transitions instead of 0% to 100% jumps
- Better user experience with visible processing feedback

## Files Modified
1. `backend/main.py` - Main progress synchronization fixes
   - Lines 1650-1651: Queue size increase
   - Lines 1806-1866: Progress callback improvements
   - Lines 1877-1921: Streaming enhancements

## Testing
The fix can be tested by:
1. Starting the backend server
2. Uploading a document through the frontend
3. Observing the progress indicator during the embedding stage
4. Verifying incremental progress updates instead of sudden jumps

## Impact
- ✅ Resolves the 0% to 100% progress jump issue
- ✅ Provides real-time feedback during vector storage operations
- ✅ Improves user experience during document uploads
- ✅ Maintains system performance with throttling
- ✅ Preserves all progress updates for accurate display
